# Evaluation Dashboard App - Mentor View

This project is a web application designed to provide a complete mentor-view solution for the evaluation of students for a semester-long project in college.
 

## Features

- **Add Students:** Mentors can add students they are interested in evaluating. Each mentor can accommodate a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students at a time. No two mentors can assign the same student during the evaluation period.
